#summary Javascript Best Practices

= Javascript Best Practices =

I've been getting into Javascript best practices lately, and here is a summary of what I've learned so far:

  * Use Aptana for editing, and activate its built-in JSLint checker (also check warnings)
  * Consistency - naming, parameter order, code organization
  * Unit tests (TDD: jQuery's testrunner, JSUnit; BDD: JSSpec)
  * Document code with ScriptDoc
  * Encapsulation (anonymous functions)
  * Libraries in single namespace
